-   scrambler
    -   can display what the scramble was for each solve
    -   allow setting scramble lengths (figure out standards for 3x3 and 2x2)
    -   add as a button thing (therefore toggleable) in the bottom right
    -   when new scramble generated add a cool slots like or cryptic animation
-   button thing on bottom right should animate and collapse into a single button
-   sessions (naming created_at etc per session)
-   statistics plots
    -   in this page, through a plot, show the distribution of solve times. for ex, how many of the solves were in the 5-6 range, 6-7 range etc (these values should be decided dynamically, but should be whole numbers)
-   figure out what else can be added (generate ideas)
